AXI Infrastructure Cores

The following IP cores, described in this document, can be included within each instance of the AXI Interconnect core, depending on the configuration of AXI 
Interconnect core and its connectivity in the IP integrator block design:
    • AXI Crossbar- connects one or more similar AXI memory-mapped masters to one or more similar memory-mapped slaves.
    • AXI Data Width Converter- connects one AXI memory-mapped master to one AXI memory-mapped slave having a wider or narrower datapath.
    • AXI Clock Converter- connects one AXI memory-mapped master to one AXI memory-mapped slave operating in a different clock domain.
    • AXI Protocol Converter- connects one AXI4, AXI3 or AXI4-Lite master to one AXI slave of a different AXI memory-mapped protocol.
    • AXI Data FIFO- connects one AXI memory-mapped master to one AXI memory-mapped slave through a set of FIFO buffers.
    • AXI Register Slice- connects one AXI memory-mapped master to one AXI memory-mapped slave through a set of pipeline registers, typically to break a critical timing path.
    • AXI MMU- provides address range decoding and remapping services for AXI Interconnect.
